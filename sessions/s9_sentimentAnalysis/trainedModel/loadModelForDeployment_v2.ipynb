To use packed padded sequences, we have to tell the RNN how long the actual sequences are. We do this by setting include_lengths = True for our TEXT field. This will cause batch.text to now be a tuple with the first element being our sentence (a numericalized tensor that has been padded) and the second element being the actual lengths of our sentences."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"UnQ2wjaQSSh2"},"source":["import torch\n","from torchtext import data\n","from torchtext import datasets\n","\n","SEED = 1234\n","\n","torch.manual_seed(SEED)\n","torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True\n","\n","TEXT = data.Field(tokenize = 'spacy', include_lengths = True)\n","LABEL = data.LabelField(dtype = torch.float)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"34f4fX-7SfTy"},"source":["We then load the IMDb dataset."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"heI_zMG1SezY"},"source":["from torchtext import datasets\n","\n","train_data, test_data = datasets.IMDB.splits(TEXT, LABEL)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"QRsXYZJJSiUi"},"source":["import random\n","\n","train_data, valid_data = train_data.split(random_state = random.seed(SEED))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"uHai8I77ToKH"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
