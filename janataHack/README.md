# Emergency vs Non-Emergency Vehicle Classification

Fatalities due to traffic delays of emergency vehicles such as ambulance & fire brigade is a huge problem. In daily life, we often see that emergency vehicles face difficulty in passing through traffic. So differentiating a vehicle into an emergency and non emergency category can be an important component in traffic monitoring as well as self drive car systems as reaching on time to their destination is critical for these services.

In this problem, you will be working on classifying vehicle images as either belonging to the emergency vehicle or non-emergency vehicle category. For the same, you are provided with the train and the test dataset. Emergency vehicles usually includes police cars, ambulance and fire brigades.

## Data Description

1. **train.zip**: contains 2 csvs and 1 folder containing image data
   1. train.csv – [‘image_names’, ‘emergency_or_not’] contains the image name and correct class for 1646 (70%) train images
   2. images – contains 2352 images for both train and test sets
2. **test.csv**: [‘image_names’] contains just the image names for the 706 (30%) test images
3. **sample_submission.csv:** [‘image_names’,’emergency_or_not­’] contains the exact format for a valid submission (1 - For Emergency Vehicle, 0 - For Non Emergency Vehicle)



## **Evaluation Metric**

The evaluation metric for this competition is Accuracy.



## **Public and Private split**

Note that the test data is further randomly divided into Public (40%) and Private (60%) data. Your initial responses will be checked and scored on the Public data.

The final rankings would be based on your private score which will be published once the competition is over.

## **Guidelines for Final Submission**

Please ensure that your final submission includes the following:

1. Solution file containing the predicted vehicle class (format is given in sample submission csv)
2. Code file for reproducing the submission, note that it is mandatory to submit your code for a valid final submission



## **Hackathon Rules**

1. *The final standings would be based on private leaderboard score*
2. Setting the final submission is recommended. Without a final submission, the submission corresponding to best public score will be taken as the final submission
3. Use of external dataset or labels from open source will lead to disqualification from the leaderboard (pretrained models are allowed)
4. Entries submitted after the contest is closed, will not be considered
5. Use of image_names as a part of model is not permitted
6. The code file pertaining to your final submission is mandatory while setting final submission for 
7. Throughout the hackathon, you are expected to respect fellow hackers and act with high integrity.
